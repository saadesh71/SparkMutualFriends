### Common Errors:
Error 1: mkdir: Call From cs6304-mrpk9-02/127.0.1.1 to localhost:9000 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused  
Explanation and Fix: In general this error comes if you are running hadoop first time on your VM after a reset. The below commands will fix it.
```
stop-all.sh
hadoop namenode -format
start-all.sh
```
You can use the below command to check if namenode, datanode and nodemanager are running.
```
jps

```

Error 2: mkdir: `hdfs://localhost:9000/user/<username>': No such file or directory  
Explanation and Fix: The error comes when there is no directory /user and /user/<username> in hdfs and you are trying to create a folder using "hadoop fs -mkdir InputFolder ".   
Below command will create the directory structure if required and solves the problem.
```
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p InputFolder
```
